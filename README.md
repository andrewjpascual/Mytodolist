This is my first application using React, CSS, and Netlify to host. With this application, users can add items, edit items, delete items, and clear all items. 
Additionally, the user will be able to refer back to the application at any later time with the use of local storage.

## Why did you build this?
I wanted to expand my frameworks knowledge and build upon ReactJS. Additionally, I want to use this as a building block towards larger React projects in the future
so that I can develop faster and more unique sites.
 
## What did you learn from this?
I believe I learned the basics of React such as components, the npm processes, effects, and code layout. I also learned how to access the web storage api (local storage)
and this in turn has interested me towards my next project to incorporate React (to practice) and using APIs.
